ID-1250	The hotel was amazing! The rooms were so big and comfy. We brought our dog with us and the welcomed her that was a huge plus for us. We also forgot a playpen for our son so we called the front desk and they brought one right up! Everything was perfect.
ID-0937	We stayed here on our way from Miami to Key West. We only had to spend a night, so we found first hotel that was available. The hotel is on the highway 1 so was the first (and only) one we tried. We paid about $60 for a room, which I thought was a bit too expensive for the hotel and neighborhood, but I was too tired to hunt for bargain.  The hotel was rated as 2 stars. I have stayed at other two star hotels, and the rooms looked comparable at first sight. However, the first room that was given to us had a terrible smell of bleach. We couldn't stand there for a minute and went back to reception and got another room. No smell in other room. Once we settled and unpacked, I started noticing small problems. The refridgerator was too loud and at night I woke up and unplugged it. The bed was so fragile that everytime I turned in sleep, it squeeked & my wife woke up. The flush in bathroom was leaking. It flushed regularly every 5 minutes and made noice. The hair dryer was not working. The hot & cold indicators in the bathroom was interchanged. Above all, when I complained to the receptionist while checking out, she looked at me as if I was being too fuzzy. No wonder none of the problems were fixed yet. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel.
ID-0911	Caesars Palace seemed like a natural stop for Vegas. It's somewhat iconic to the location. However, that's what I ended up not really liking about it. It seemed like they were far too focused on being iconic, and not enough on actually being a hotel. It just felt a bit too much like I was in a casino with beds, compared to an actual high quality hotel.
ID-1134	My husband and I were recently on a business trip to Seattle that coincided with his birthday; while he was working one day I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to celebrate by whisking him away to Victoria, British Columbia for the weekend. I booked a package deal which included ferry tickets, a champagne brunch, and two nights at the famed Fairmont Empress hotel.  I kept our hotel location a secret from my husband until we arrived, and I'm so glad I did! After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped.   Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.  This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway).   This hotel was one of the few I've ever stayed in that I can actually say I was content to just spend time in; wandering various floors, exploring some fascinating history and relaxing in the refined yet comfortable ambiance.  A once in a lifetime stay!
ID-0995	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Vintage Plaza for the first night of our honeymoon, before we traveled the next day. While the hotel itself was beautiful, most of the staff friendly, and the amenities pretty spectacular, one event marred our stay and has left us completely unwilling to ever stay in this facility again. The day we checked out, we realized that we had forgotten one of the cards we received from family on the desk. We called the front desk just before we left town, and they said they'd have housekeeping check for the card and bring it to the front desk.   A week later, when we returned, we called the hotel, and they advised us they had found the card. We stopped in on the way home, and I went to the front desk. They handed me the card, and I was shocked to find that the envelope had been opened! I immediately asked to speak to the manager on duty, and when I pointed out to him that someone on his staff had opened our envelope, we were rebuffed stating that, no one on his staff would ever do that. I knew I wouldn't get any further with him, so I left. I did write a letter to the general manager, which also was rebuffed with the statement that, no one on their staff would have opened the envelope, you must have done it.   Needless to say, we will never return to this hotel, and will never recommend it to any of our friends.
ID-0919	Do not stay at the Days Inn. First, when we got to the front counter and rang the bell, it took TEN minutes for someone to finally approach us. The young woman who did was more interested in her phone than in talking to us. Once we got our keycard we found our room and expected to at least have something average there. Wrong! The bedsheets and everything were everywhere. Also, there was trash in the cans and on the counter. The room also smelled like cigarette smoke. We will never be staying here again.
ID-1254	My wife and I spent our honeymoon at Sandals Grande St. Lucian and absolutely fell in love the place. Our room was very spacious and had a nice flat screen TV. There was also three different pools to choose from. The main pool even had a swim up bar. Even better yet, the beach was amazing. This was true a true paradise.
ID-1025	I have stayed at The Inn At The Convention Center for a total of one week on separate occasions. First, if you can get past the curt responses of the near inhuman clerks in the front office, you will make your way into one of the worst hotel experiences of your life. Taking a trip in the elevator feels as if it will be your last. It is squeaky, smells strongly of cleaning detergents, and runs slowly. Once you arrive on your floor, the smell of cleaning agents is even stronger than the smell of the elevator. It buries itself into one's pores and haunts your entire stay. As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture. It is a haven for young party animals, noise included. Additionally, the wi-fi is terrible, if and when it works at all. You would be better off saving your money for a different hotel in a different location. You won't be sorry you did.
ID-1064	A night at the Hotel Roanoke is a charming experience and the perfect overnight getaway. there are many venues to experience from enjoying a quality gourmet meal in The regency room to enjoy the luxury of late night drinks in the Pine Room, complimentary big cookies waiting for us in our room. A walkway connects the hotel with the downtown shops, restaurants and large farmer's market.  The opportunity of exploration are endless in this beautiful city, Roanoke it self being known as the festival city of Virginia always has something going on form the festival in the park to Dickens of a Christmas its a amazing place to visit
ID-1132	I thought that this hotel was great. The resort was huge, had many pools, and offered many dinning options. They also had a shuttle that would take you to all the different theme parks as well as many on sight activities to do everyday of the week. You could do paddle boats, play tennis and basketball, and play a round of mini-golf.
ID-1269	This hotel is overpriced and the room I got did not have a good view even though I paid extra for a better view. All the shops and activities costs a lot more than others.
ID-0848	While in San Francisco this last month a friend and I stayed at The Argonaut on Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel was absolutely spectacular from the helpful and attentive hotel staff to the wonderful rooms and amenities. The hotel restaurant, The Blue Mermaid, was a real treat. The food was so delicious and reasonably priced too. My friend and I had so much fun on our trip and so much of it was because of the hotel and its lovely staff. I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and family!
ID-1239	Worst place I've ever stayed. We booked the room a few days prior to arrival but when we got there to check in they had given our room to someone else. They then said they were going to upgrade our room. The upgraded room was on the bottom floor with a car parked right in front of the door and we could barely get in the door. But even worse, the room had not been cleaned. There was trash and food everywhere and the bed was a mess.  They didn't even offer a discount or anything when we complained and asked for a clean room.   The walls are paper thin. You can hear everything in the next room and the noise from the shops on the other side.
ID-0828	Exciting, one-stop resort for the perfect vacation!  Our weekend getaway at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was fantastic! Our room was beautiful and we met so many nice people also on vacation.   The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a shoppers dream! The first day I shopped 'til I dropped while the boys checked out the famous Diamond Head beach close by. Hilton Hawaiian Village has it all--bars, lounges, a spa, tons of shopping, convenience stores, restaurants, pools, and so much more! We never even had to travel more than 5 minutes!
ID-1008	I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. What a fantastic hotel! We were treated to a scenic drive through Las Vegas on the way to our hotel. Once we arrived, we went upstairs to check out our room. It was beautiful! We had a fantastic view of the Red Rock Mountains. The bathtub was luxuriously large and the bubble bath mix they provided smelled divine. The beds were soft and cozy. The decor was very tasteful and reminded me of being in a spa. My husband and I enjoyed gambling downstairs. The slots were relatively loose and we won quite a bit considering we hardly spent any money. We absolutely loved dining at the variety of restaurants located inside the casino. They have Mexican, American, German and Italian food, plus several other types of cuisines. Everywhere we went, we were greeted with attentive service and delicious food. I especially enjoyed dining at Cabo, the hotel's Mexican restaurant. There is a bar in the center that features a massive chandelier made of bottles. The margaritas were strong and inexpensive. The gaming attendants we met while gambling were very friendly and didn't mind explaining the rules to us when we weren't sure how each game worked. I am so thankful that Aliante Station employs people who love their job! I am already looking into booking my next stay and can't wait to return.
ID-1016	The historic Mayfair Hotel is a great hotel to stay at. It looks a little dingy from the outside, but inside it is very elegant looking. My kids enjoyed sitting in the plush waiting room chairs while I checked us in. The elevator up to our room was noiseless and quick. The room we received was very nice. Everything was in its place and my kids enjoyed the view onto the street. We had their continental breakfast the next morning and everything was perfect, just like the breakfast I would cook at home for my kids. Will recommend this hotel to others and my family and friends.
ID-1143	If you are a smoker And you request a smoking room it is going to smell horrible! They are normally a decent rate but during special seasons when people from Canada come down they jack the prices up to 5 star hotel rates! Which can last for months! Rooms did not have microwaves or refrigerators!
ID-0922	The Dillon Inn is a great place to stay if you want inexpensive lodging near the mountains. We are 15 to 30 minutes away from Breckenridge, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin. Vail is only about 45 minutes away. The hotel has nice rooms, hot tub accessibility, and a shuttle to Keystone in the morning.
ID-0850	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is an amazing hotel that I would recommend to anyone. The rates are great and the slots are loose. They have amazing deals, especially if you are willing to go during the week instead of the weekend. There are multiple restaurants to choose from, so any appetite can be satisfied. There is a ton of parking and it is right in the middle of everything you could possibly want to do in Reno. Also, there is a Cabellas not too far away for something fun to do during the day after a long night of winning at gambling!
ID-1205	The Wynn hotel was not all that is was supposed to be for our Las Vegas trip. For the price and rating you would think that the rooms were not be as stark and just plain dull as they were. The location was ok. I have stayed at three star hotels that were better located. The sport book was very small and my husband actually went to another hotel's sport book. The Wynn hotel really lacked the character and theme that you would expect a five star hotel to have in Las vegas.
