ID-1162	This is a fantastic botique hotel in Portland, Oregon. All the rooms are suites and include a kitchenette. This hotel is great for small families because it allows you ample space and you have the kitchen included where you can prepare some meals in order to save on some food costs while on vacation. The best part is that there are piles of Starbursts candies throughout the hotel available for the taking!
ID-0797	My children and I stayed at this hotel in New Orleans in January, 2012. When we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait for over 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the front desk. Once we finally got the key and made it to our room, the room was dirty. There was even a dirty town in the floor from the previous guest. I called the front desk to complain, however, no one showed up to clean until the next day. There is supposed to be a perk at this hotel where they have free hot snacks in the evening. They were anything but hot. It was basically room temp chicken nuggets and hot dogs. Find another hotel if you expect to have an enjoyable stay. This one was total disappointment.
ID-0891	NOT RECOMMENDED. The elevators are slow, the rooms are small and the staff is very rude. My wife called the front desk and asked for fresh towels to be brought up to our room. The clerk told her that he was busy but she could go downstairs and get them herself. She asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't one. Terrible customer service!
ID-1118	I live in Houston and I usually stay at the Galvez Hotel on Galveston Island at least one or two times a year, as I live in Houston, which is about an hour away in good traffic. I like to go down there as a quick weekend getaway, to relax and unwind. They have a bed and breakfast deal that suits my needs perfectly. I’ve always liked their historical ambience, and they’ve updated the décor in recent times which makes it an even more attractive place. The staff is always pleasant and the rooms are always clean, peaceful and quiet, which are all major attractions for me. The hotel is supposed to be haunted, and I would love to see a ghost, but to date, I have never had so much as one paranormal experience. Despite my lack of ghostly encounters, I still love staying at the hotel because of its historic ambience, tranquility and beachfront location. One of my more pleasant memories of the Galvez is standing on the beach there at dawn, with coffee in hand and watching the sun come up over the ocean. The hotel is close to several of Galveston’s attractions that I like to visit. I come down to eat at nearby Pier 21 and have one of their shrimp poor boys, go shopping on the Strand and visit Moody gardens, which has a great saltwater aquarium and a wonderful rainforest pyramid, loaded with tropical birds and butterflies. If you want a loud, crazy place, then fly to Las Vegas, but if you need to relax and unwind, stay at the Hotel Galvez on Galveston Island.
ID-0903	Did not like the service that i was provided, when i entered the hotel. I also did not like the area, in which the hotel was located. Too much noise and events going on for me to feel relax and away from the city life.
ID-0803	On my way home from a trip with my family, the drive was taking longer than expected, so we decided to stay in a hotel for the evening. It was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. Unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. The walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. When they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. The room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. Also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed Big Foot. Overall, it was a terrible experience.
ID-1009	When we came into our room it had not been cleaned by housekeeping yet. We notified the front desk who moved us to another room. We reserved a non smoking room however the room smelled like old, stale smoke. It also had a musty odor as if there was mold or mildew somewhere. The furnishings were outdated and in poor condition. The lighting was poor which added to the drab appearance. The air conditioner was loud and leaked. The hotel was in a location that I did not feel safe in.
ID-1214	This hotel is very clean. Rooms were very nice in size. Cookies at the front desk just waiting for your enjoyment and pleasure. The hotel provides elevator service with luggage carts for your convience. They have a wonderful hot tub and pool to cool off after a hot day here. This hotel has a laundry facility as well. It is no wonder why people return here year after year. The service here is very warm and down to home. Comfort awaites you here in the country.
ID-1017	I stayed at the Super 8 location in East Lansing, Michigan. It was cheap, but there's a good reason for that- the entire place is a wreck. The staircases up to the motel rooms were filthy, and some of the glass attached to the railing was broken. Once you got to the room, the carpets were discolored, and the room had a strange, pungent smell to it. I wouldn't stay there again.
ID-1224	Hampton Inn and Suites in Lakeland Florida was a great place to stay! We stayed for a Dance competition for my daughter who is 12. the staff was great, the rooms were all on the same floor and we even had a free hot breakfast! I loved this hotels location, it was in the middle of a shopping mall and the girls loved to go out there and walk around or go to the movies all while staying at the hotel A+ Location and service!
ID-1213	This hotel had no luggage carts available so you carried your luggage from the car to the hotel room. You had to hunt down the staff for any extra linens you may need also. Rooms are not as they apear in the picture. The pool if it is running will be available for limited hours only. The traffic noise outside will be a sure way for you to loose a good nights sleep. Don't expect any refreshments like a coffee bar here. Oh they have one but they run out of coffee before you get a cup. Donut's for breakfast here are right in line with box donuts you buy in the store. Save your money and go to a hotel that offers more service, quite atomsphere and quality care!
ID-0978	This hotel was a nice place to spend a night. The room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. All of the other guests were very quiet. The hotel was able to accomodate several rooms for our family during our family reunion. It was conveniently located near restaurants and a bank with an ATM. It was nice to have restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is not that far from an outlet mall that is a very popular place to shop. It is also not far from Portland.
ID-0906	Centrally located, this facility has everything and is nearby to everything. Excellent food in the sumptuous restaurant. Excellent communication with the outside world. A stay to remember. thanks, blf.
ID-1217	La Quinta Inn and Suites is a low end national lodging chain that is best to avoid for the business professional. While La Quinta offers rooms at an affordable rate, the sleepless nights make it way too expensive. The rooms are reasonably nice, but the general construction of La Quinta facilities includes walls so thin that you can hear your neighbor clear their throat. Additionally, the chain is a hotspot for families on vacation, so that means kids and animals lending to the disruption. And while there is a pool, it is often so cold that it is unbearable to enjoy. The staff don't exactly go out of their way for their client either. Is a restful sleep is desired, drive on past La Quinta.
ID-0862	I was so happy to drive up to the Hampton Inn in Manhattan, Kansas after a long drive from Conway, Arkansas! The parking lot and lobby entrance were well-lit and clean, and the staff member that checked me was incredibly helpful. He went above and beyond to accommodate my many requests (allergies = no down-filled pillows!), which I very much appreciated. My room was conveniently located on the first floor, where I had easy access to their gym and pool, and I was only steps away from the complimentary coffee and tea station! The room was cozy and charmingly decorated, which made me feel right at home. The free continental breakfast was fantastic, and included many healthy options as well as more traditional breakfast choices. I didn't travel with kids, but I can imagine that this hotel would be a good choice for parents because the pool was indoor and heated, and the dining area contained 2 large flat screen televisions with access to the remote! I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit the Manhattan, KS area. Go Cats!
ID-1109	The hotel was restricted in various areas. I did go when they were remodeling so there was sections of the hotel that was blocked off. They said it was because they were expanding the hotel. It would have been nice to know that they were remodeling when I made the reservation.  The food selection in the restaurant was on the higher priced side. The room has a bar size fridge and a small Microwave. It is important to bring your own food as there is no real reasonable transportation into town.
ID-1047	The hotel was not what expected the people where very rude And the room cost,to much just to stay one night was too much money
ID-1041	Upon checking into this hotel and heading to our room, we were inconvenienced right off the bat when the handle of the toilet fell off. This meant a trip back down to the front desk and then having to re-pack and move to a different room.  After finally getting settled in, we went to the pool for a quick swim and to relax in the hot tub. The facilities were small, smelled heavily of chemicals, and had the smallest, itchiest towels. The worst was the main wall was one open window that faced the main hallway---which means that everyone coming and going gawked at us the entire time we were there.  The continental breakfast had your basics (juice, donuts, eggs, cereal), but the space was tiny. We ended up taking our breakfast up to our rooms because the same people were camped out there all morning. The hotel looks nice, but for the price the inconveniences were too much.
ID-0948	Stayed for business for 4 nights. The rooms were very large, very spacious. I like that there was an actual door between the sleeping area and the living area. The pool was open late which was great because all of the kids were gone.
ID-0868	My hotel experience was great. The pool was nice and cool, the staff was so friendly and helpful, and the rates are unbeatable! Desk clerk assistance was willing to help me get ice at 4 AM. So very nice and understanding. I was in town for a wedding, and my brother in-law stayed at a Holiday Inn down the street; I still hear stories about how he wishes he had stayed at the America's Best Value Inn! Would recommend to anyone.
