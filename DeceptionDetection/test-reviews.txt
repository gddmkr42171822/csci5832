ID-1040	The Grand Hyatt New York is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. This is an ideal for the business traveler, as they provide Wi-Fi, a 24-hour business center, and a spacious work area in the hotel rooms themselves. They also have ample meeting space and offer catering for meetings. Ample modern audio visual equipment is supplied so there is no need to bring any along. For those who have traveled to midtown for work, it is a very short jaunt to just about any midtown office building. Cabs are readily available in inclement weather or if you have a heavy load to carry. The hotel concierge can arrange car service as well. The hotel is very gracious about honoring special requests, such as early check-in, late check-out and high floors/quiet rooms and rooms away from the elevators. I have stayed in many business hotels in New York and the Grand Hyatt New York exceeds them all.
ID-1266	The Beachcomber Resort & Villas is what makes South Florida, South Florida. The moment I walked in I was taken back by the beautiful décor, and greeted by friendly staff. I was able to check in quickly, and with no hassle. The room was more amazing then expected! It had a BEAUTIFUL view! I looked out and saw ALL of Ft. Lauderdale on a crystal clear day. At this point, I decided I’d rather be on the beach then look at it, and no sooner then that I walked out the back door of the hotel, and was right on the beach. Beachcomber is amazing, the rooms, the service, the amenities all exceeded my very high expectations.
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.  I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer.   The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping!   I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water!   All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.
ID-0867	The management was unfriendly, the pool was a glorified bath tub, the smoke free hotel room smelled like a tobacco field, our electronic key card stopped working at 4 AM (we were returning from a wedding reception) and there was no one at the desk until 4:30. Imagine being drunk and tired and having to use the toilet and having to wait 30 minutes at 4 in the morning....No thank you.
ID-1064	A night at the Hotel Roanoke is a charming experience and the perfect overnight getaway. there are many venues to experience from enjoying a quality gourmet meal in The regency room to enjoy the luxury of late night drinks in the Pine Room, complimentary big cookies waiting for us in our room. A walkway connects the hotel with the downtown shops, restaurants and large farmer's market.  The opportunity of exploration are endless in this beautiful city, Roanoke it self being known as the festival city of Virginia always has something going on form the festival in the park to Dickens of a Christmas its a amazing place to visit
ID-0953	When I checked into the hotel, I was informed the elevator was not working. I had to truck up the stairs, with my luggage, by self. I was provided no help from the staff. The air conditioner was broken, which created a very stuffy room. When I took a shower, the stopper was stuck shut, so by the end of the shower, the water was almost overflowing.
ID-0849	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is not even a hotel that I would send my worst enemy. Not only is the place in the middle of the armpit of America (Reno), but the hotel is just a mess. Everything, and I mean, everything smells like smoke. The smoking is supposed to be in the casino area only, but that is hardly the case. There are multiple restaurants, but they are usually closed and the food is horrible anyway. It is terribly old and it definitely shows in the rooms and in the casino. It is in serious need of a renovation asap.
ID-1001	The hotel was pretty nice on the outside for the most part, but when we got to the hallway our room was on the wall paper was in the middle of being replaced so it was all torn down, the carpets were getting ripped up. If they were in the middle of renovations I wish they just put us in a different hallway, or at least given us a discount.
ID-1122	I stayed at the Red Lion in Anehiem, CA. It was within walking distance of Disneyland, which was great. The interior of the hotel was beautiful. The marble floors in the lobby were goreous. The room was tastefully decorated, with a beautiful bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was clean. The housekeeping was great. I also loved the great HD TV available in the room. I would stay again!
ID-1130	On my last vacation, I decided I wanted to go to a place that was quaint and quiet, but still had a suitable level of culture to partake in. This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future. Thanks Planters Inn!
ID-0878	I just adored staying in this hotel. I inquired at the front desk, and the helpful employee told me that the structure was only six years old. You can tell! Everything is so new and well-kept-up-with. There is even a fabulous restaurant downstairs! We were so glad to see that we would not have to eat the typical continental breakfast in the morning, but would instead get a nice hot meal. They were even upgrading the indoor pool when we visited with a water feature, so we will be sure to visit again to check on its progress!
ID-1071	I stayed at the Microtel in Charlotte, NC 3 weeks ago and I will never make that mistake again. The rooms were small, the staff was disinterested and I swear I saw a bug lurking in the corner behind the toilet. Though the Microtel is only a short distance from the local airport, I spent most of the night trying to sleep while flights kept going by. Never again. 2 stars. Bottom line: The rooms may be cheap, but you get what you pay for.
ID-1109	The hotel was restricted in various areas. I did go when they were remodeling so there was sections of the hotel that was blocked off. They said it was because they were expanding the hotel. It would have been nice to know that they were remodeling when I made the reservation.  The food selection in the restaurant was on the higher priced side. The room has a bar size fridge and a small Microwave. It is important to bring your own food as there is no real reasonable transportation into town.
ID-1035	The Westin in St. Louis is located in the center of St. Louis. The hotel was dingy and you can easily get lost in the hotel. The halls are a maze. The rooms were ugly and dirty.
ID-0970	Our stay at the Arizona Grand was awesome! Our room was spacious, the bed was comfy, and we even got a balcony to enjoy (great for drying the kids' swimsuits after a day at the included waterpark). It was nice to have a separate bedroom and living room, and the summer time events were great (movie at the water park, which was also on tv if you wanted to stay in). We even used the hotel pool a few times when we were just worn out from the park activities and wanted some quiet. And speaking of quiet, for as busy as the resort was on a holiday weekend, you would never know from how quiet it was in our rooms! The hotel is wonderfully clean and well-kept, and I felt very safe staying here with my children. I would definitely stay here again!
ID-0944	The Holiday Inn in Rosslyn is a cheap hotel in a great location. There is a great view of the Potomac River, it is a block away from a metro station, and a short walk to Georgetown. It is also convenient to Reagan National Airport. The hotel also has free wifi and a restaurant/bar on the top floor that offers amazing views of Washington.
ID-1167	Hotel Penn is a cheap hotel, and for good reason. Our bedsheets were stained, the paint is pealing, and the bathroom was disgusting. The bed was also very uncomfortable, and the TV was incredibly old-fashioned. The place smelled, and the cleaning staff was unhelpful. We had to wait in an incredibly long line to check in, and there was no free wifi.
ID-1139	This hotel is located in downtown Richmond which is nothing short of a ghetto. The outside, while attractive, does not hold the modern flair I expect in a hotel. The inside of the hotel makes it seem like they tried to hard to reflect earlier times and I had a hard time finding the room. The layout of the hotel is confusing and the room was old and musty smelling. The staff are also impolite, the restaurant is overly expensive (especially for a beer) and the food was not as good as other restaurants we ate at in the area. The hotel was overpriced, but there are better options in Richmond from what I understand after doing my research. Beware.
ID-0870	We stayed at the Days in on 39th in Brooklyn for about 5 days in December. My daughter needed to find a place to live and register for school. This was the cheapest hotel we could find in Brooklyn. We thought it would be really bad but it was actually clean and pleasant. The staff were very helpful when we needed to get a cab. There was a free buffet breakfast. It was edible and the coffee was great. For the money I give it five stars.
ID-0948	Stayed for business for 4 nights. The rooms were very large, very spacious. I like that there was an actual door between the sleeping area and the living area. The pool was open late which was great because all of the kids were gone.
