ID-0849	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is not even a hotel that I would send my worst enemy. Not only is the place in the middle of the armpit of America (Reno), but the hotel is just a mess. Everything, and I mean, everything smells like smoke. The smoking is supposed to be in the casino area only, but that is hardly the case. There are multiple restaurants, but they are usually closed and the food is horrible anyway. It is terribly old and it definitely shows in the rooms and in the casino. It is in serious need of a renovation asap.
ID-0915	I was hoping to be able to spend my night somewhere nice for my birthday to get away but boy did I make a big mistake! The room was unclean and the beds unmade. When we went to the office to complain they did every little to apologize and made very little effort to fix the situation. Rude and unclean! I do not plan on returning during my next stay.
ID-1268	The Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas is a great place to stay if you're looking for a place to unwind after a your wild nights in Vegas. Upon arriving the first thing you'll notice is there is plenty of easily accessible parking, that won't have you walking too far to get to your room. You'll enter and notice a large lobby with good abeyance and quick service. The food offered inside the hotel is great. The food court offers cuisine from all over the world, for cheap and affordable prices. The Indian food was AWESOME, quick and cheap compared to most of the prices you'll be looking at in Vegas. When I entered my room I was stunned by the size. For the $30 a night rate, I was not expecting a large comfortable room! The bathroom was more comfortable than being home. When do you ever get that? The staff at the Riviera was all sorts of friendly, even helping us find our way around the strip and letting us know some fun places to go that our 20 year old friends, and of-drinking-age friends could all have a blast. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm booking my room at the Riviera.
ID-1238	I've stayed at the 16th Street Mall Westin more than 60 nights in the past four years, on a combined business/personal trips. The staff and management of the hotel have always been friendly and guest driven in their service.   Love the hotel's location. In fact the reason I first stayed at the hotel is the fact it's on the 16th Street Mall and within walking distance of our corporate office. In fact after the first trip I stopped renting a car, there just was no need for one. The view of the mountains from the upper floors is breathtaking. The king sized bed has always been world class, as they are in every Westin I've stayed at.  The room comfort and staff friendliness are the reason I stay at this hotel every trip to Denver.
ID-0941	I stayed at this hotel when I was trekking across Pennsylvania to get to New York City the next day. I was extremely disappointed by my stay here! The staff ignored most of my questions and brushed those questions off of their shoulders like eh, it can wait. I was even more baffled with disgust when I entered my extremely stuffy room to find a TV that did not work, and a very low internet connection that I PAID to connect to! The meal was great though, room service was mediocre at best, and the bed was surprisingly very comfortable. This hotel was by far the worst I've ever stayed at, you can tell that these people were just in it for the money and had no people skills.
ID-1164	The Naples Grande Beach Resort by Waldorf Astoria is a fabulous hotel located in the pristine beaches of Florida's Gulf Coast. This wonderful property features an unparalleled location overlooking the ocean while sipping a drink from your room's balcony. Helpful staff and high standards of service and cleanliness make it a great place to relax for a few days. If you are traveling with your family, Naples Grande features many amenities for kids, including a very entertaining pool complete with water slides and water activities. A second pool is available for those who wish a more quiet atmosphere while still enjoying pool-side service.   Located just a few minutes from downtown Naples, you can always venture out for dinner in town, or for some shopping. However, if you just want to get away you can park your car and forget about it until it is time to venture back to reality! Everything you may need is available at this fabulous hotel!
ID-1009	When we came into our room it had not been cleaned by housekeeping yet. We notified the front desk who moved us to another room. We reserved a non smoking room however the room smelled like old, stale smoke. It also had a musty odor as if there was mold or mildew somewhere. The furnishings were outdated and in poor condition. The lighting was poor which added to the drab appearance. The air conditioner was loud and leaked. The hotel was in a location that I did not feel safe in.
ID-0967	We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there. The room was not clean, we had to scrub the bathtub before we even thought about using it. Airplanes continually roared above our room, which must have been right under a major landing path for the nearby airport. We expected a higher level of service and room amenities than we received. The outdoor pool was not heated, and it was frigid for late-August. The pool area was also not clean. We were glad for the morning to come so that we could leave and be on our way.
ID-1005	I would never stay in the hotel again. The carpet looked and smelled as if it had been trampled on by a bunch of wet dogs. The microwave looked as if it hadn't been truly cleaned in months, not to mention the decor of the room looked as if it were chosen from a scene of an 80's movie. They claim to have free wifi but you have to call the front desk for a login code, well if no one answers at the front desk, this is pretty useless. The pictures on the website definitely overestimate the attractiveness of the indoor pool area.......the kiddie pool was the size of one of the baby pools that you buy for $10 at walmart. Needless to say, we were not impressed with the atmosphere. This may be a nice getaway for college kids that plan on being wasted the entire stay (this way the defects of the hotel woould not be apparent)!
ID-1118	I live in Houston and I usually stay at the Galvez Hotel on Galveston Island at least one or two times a year, as I live in Houston, which is about an hour away in good traffic. I like to go down there as a quick weekend getaway, to relax and unwind. They have a bed and breakfast deal that suits my needs perfectly. I’ve always liked their historical ambience, and they’ve updated the décor in recent times which makes it an even more attractive place. The staff is always pleasant and the rooms are always clean, peaceful and quiet, which are all major attractions for me. The hotel is supposed to be haunted, and I would love to see a ghost, but to date, I have never had so much as one paranormal experience. Despite my lack of ghostly encounters, I still love staying at the hotel because of its historic ambience, tranquility and beachfront location. One of my more pleasant memories of the Galvez is standing on the beach there at dawn, with coffee in hand and watching the sun come up over the ocean. The hotel is close to several of Galveston’s attractions that I like to visit. I come down to eat at nearby Pier 21 and have one of their shrimp poor boys, go shopping on the Strand and visit Moody gardens, which has a great saltwater aquarium and a wonderful rainforest pyramid, loaded with tropical birds and butterflies. If you want a loud, crazy place, then fly to Las Vegas, but if you need to relax and unwind, stay at the Hotel Galvez on Galveston Island.
ID-0804	I would highly reccommend this hotel for many reasons. Nestled in the woods, right off of highway 299, The Big Foot Motel is a major attraction. There is a cage which once captured Big Foot which serves as a great photo opportunity. The rooms are quaint and cozy, with cute curtains on the window. The showers are warm and the staff is friendly. If I am ever in the area again, I will return without a doubt!
ID-1095	Unless you care only about getting a low price and are not looking to have a pleasant stay, avoid this hotel. The staff is rude, impatient and impersonal, the rooms are poorly kept and the the food is extremely mediocre. The supplies you are given also seem pretty obviously to be bargain-bin junk. In fact, this place would be better classified as lodging than a hotel. The location however is relatively good, but there are much better hotels to consider.
ID-0972	This place may boast of vintage quality, but with rooms as small as these, one might as well rest in their vehicles to have a more comfortable time. Some of the rooms boast antique tubs alone. However, there is no shower option for these rooms, since only select baths have had them installed.   While the attempt to maintain a Victorian setting is quaint, some of the quality was threadbare and tattered. A broken window and blinds that hardly kept the light from bedrooms make for a night of restlessness that was amplified by an odd banging on the pipes throughout the hours.  This place is far too overpriced for what they boast, and the lack of amenities one might fight at a higher quality hotel makes for a waste of time and money.
ID-0856	The Motel at 58th Avenue and I-25 in Denver is very nice place to stay and very convenient to downtown and the northern suburbs. Check-in was fast and hassle free.   Once I got to my room it was clean, fresh and furnished in classic western decor. They had extended cable access on a 42 flat panel LED TV. The wifi access was free and fast.  The morning buffet was hot and cooked to order.
ID-0834	My family’s recent vacation stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Modesto, California was absolutely wonderful! The rooms were updated, well kept, and extremely clean. Not to mention, the pillow-top beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept in! As a matter of fact, I asked the gal at the front desk to supply the manufacturer of the beds so we can order one for our own home! The continental breakfast each morning was plentiful, varied, and delicious! From waffles and biscuits and gravy to fresh fruit and pastries, my family had a more than sufficient meal to start each day out right. We always stay at Hampton Inn’s because of the great quality and reputation they offer. We cannot wait to come back!
ID-1243	I received a discount coupon from one of my friend and when I went to the hotel they said it's not legitimate coupon. I was very shocked by that since it was from legitimate source. Anyway, we decided to pay the full price since hotel looked good and I had heard good things about it. As soon as I entered the room there were stains on the carpet and bedsheet wasn't changed from last customers who stayed in the room. Called the staff to report it but no one picked up the call. I would never visit it again.
ID-1069	Did not like the food and the noise level around my room. I also did not like the room service, which got my order wrong twice. In addition i didn't get any treats after my check out. Did not experience the night life of being in NYC because my hotel room was hard to find, due to millions of people going in and out of the hotel. I give it a 3 out of 5.
ID-0840	We checked in to the Doubletree Suites in Melbourne FL 3 days after Christmas and our stay was wonderful. We were greeted at the front desk with warm chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven. The room was clean and comfortable and the king sized bed was a real treat. It was also nice that they kept the holiday music playing in the lobby and at the pool throughout our stay even though Christmas had passed. The pool was heated, the beach was beautiful. We found the staff to be friendly and open to our requests. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wanted to vacation at an upscale hotel.
ID-0892	What a great place to stay! Room sizes are just right and the freeway is right next door. To top it off the staff is so friendly and helpful.
ID-1221	I recently visited Las Vegas for work function and stayed at the Flamingo Hotel and was extremely underwhelmed with my experience. My first negative for the hotel was experienced as soon as I walked in the door! The smoke smell was overwhelming and it was very obvious that this hotel is quite old. I went on to check in and stood in line for twenty minutes only to be told that my room was not ready! This would be understandable if I had arrived prior to check in time, but I arrived at 7:00 PM! I was extremely upset and told that there was nothing they could do! I was forced to meander around the casino for another forty-five minutes until my room was ready.  After getting to my room, I was even more upset! It did not appear to have been very well kept. There were stains on the carpets, hair on the bathroom floor, and it smelled very musky. I asked for a non-smoking room but it was very obvious that this room had been smoked in. I called the front desk to complain and was told that they could try to get me in a different room tomorrow, but that there were no other room available tonight. Since I was forced to stay in this room at least for the night, I decided to head down to get some food. I ate at Margaritaville and was not pleased with the loud music and the repetitive show that I had to endure while there. The food was ok, but seemed to be overpriced for what I got.  I made the best of my night and was told the next day that they would not be able to relocate me to a better room. I still had plans of being in Vegas for another 3 nights and did not want to deal with this stench! I decided to go across the street to Caesars Palace and got right in to an updated, smoke free room. I do not plan to ever return to the Flamingo Las Vegas. You get what you pay for at this hotel. Low price, low class.
