Part 1:
With the original Naive Bayes from homework 2, I was labeling around %48 of the reviews correctly.



Part 2:
I tried to stem the words and the percentage I got correct barely improved (went up a %1 point).
I tried to find patterns with POS tagging and according to this article (https://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/N13-1053.pdf)
typically a fake reviews had more verbs relative to nouns.  I did find this but I was not sure
what to do with that information.
