Part 1:
----------------
1. With the original Naive Bayes from homework 2, I was labeling around %48 of the reviews correctly.



Part 2:
-------------------------
1. I tried to stem the words and the percentage I got correct barely improved (went up a %1 point).
2. I tried to find patterns with POS tagging and according to this article (https://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/N13-1053.pdf)
	Typically a fake reviews had more verbs relative to nouns.  I did find this but I was not sure what to do with that information.
3. I then tried based on that same article and forum posts on moodle to use a support vector classifier and the chi squared test feature extractor
	of the scikit library.  This labeled around %52 of the reviews correctly.
