ID-1136	I was very impressed with the hotel. The exterior of the hotel was one thing, which is simply marvelous, but it was probably the roomiest hotel in the Concord, NH area. It is close to my brother's school, had excellent service and pretty nifty free toiletry, nice bathrooms, free internet connection and more. The attendants were very attentive, and I would love to stay there again if not for the price.
ID-1154	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Fairfield Inn and Suites in downtown Louisville, Kentucky a few weekends ago. The hotel was conveniently located right off I-65 and the hotel provided adequate parking. We arrived before check-in but our room was ready for us. Room decor is modern and colorful and I liked that the bath and lavatory were separate. The hotel was quiet and clean and the complimentary breakfast was one of the best I've had at a hotel -- fresh fruit, homemade waffles, bacon and eggs, etc, etc. Would definitely stay again if travelling to the area.
ID-1178	Once you book a room at the Baltimore Hyatt Regency Hotel, you will get an instant feeling of being right at home. The hotel staff greets all of it's customers with warm smiles and candy. The hotel staff, upon request, can give you a tour of the room that you plan to book. Once you are in your hotel room, the rooms are emmaculate. Overlooking the Inner Harbor and all of it's attractions. I was able to visit the attractions, have dinner in the hotel's dining room, and kick back and enjoy the room.
ID-1078	I decided to stay at the Japan House Suites thinking that it would be just like any other motel and for the amazing rate I figured the rooms wouldn't be all that great. But, boy was I WRONG. The owners were very nice, helpful, and have AMAZING customer service. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. And in the morning they make a made to order breakfast, which steak and eggs is one of the items on the menu. I couldn't believe this great hotel that i found especially for such a bargain!
ID-1238	I've stayed at the 16th Street Mall Westin more than 60 nights in the past four years, on a combined business/personal trips. The staff and management of the hotel have always been friendly and guest driven in their service.   Love the hotel's location. In fact the reason I first stayed at the hotel is the fact it's on the 16th Street Mall and within walking distance of our corporate office. In fact after the first trip I stopped renting a car, there just was no need for one. The view of the mountains from the upper floors is breathtaking. The king sized bed has always been world class, as they are in every Westin I've stayed at.  The room comfort and staff friendliness are the reason I stay at this hotel every trip to Denver.
ID-0991	The Ste Marie Marie Antoinette Hotel, now renamed the Hotel Le Marais, is located in the heart of the popular French Quarter of New Orleans. Its location is convenient to the sights of the Quarter. Unfortunately that is the one positive aspect of this tired hotel. The property is in need of a renovation to the rooms and the common space. During my stay the pool was not operational, and the restaurant/bar was not open. The rooms were below average for similarly priced hotels in the French Quarter. The hotel's brochure featured photographs that were either heavily retouched, or taken when the property had seen much better times.
ID-0803	On my way home from a trip with my family, the drive was taking longer than expected, so we decided to stay in a hotel for the evening. It was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. Unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. The walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. When they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. The room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. Also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed Big Foot. Overall, it was a terrible experience.
ID-0807	I stayed at the Adam's Mark Buffalo for an extended stay. While I was there I became very unsatisfied with the hotel as a whole. The maid and restaurant staff were not only unfriendly but at times down right rude. The hotel had bed bugs and leaking windows which ruined some of my belongings. The food, even a fruit salad would take over an half hour to arrive when you could see the staff sitting around and talking. I heard multiple rude or sexual comments from the staff. The carpets were dirty and smelled.
ID-0817	The hotel has very thin walls and ceiling so you can hear EVERYTHING. You can even hear full conversations word-for-word. Even when we complained to have someone tell the person above us to be quiet, the manager didn't do anything at all. There was a county fair going on with bus fulls of high school kids having a party right outside our door and were shooting off fireworks. However, no one told them to be quiet. All the manager told us was that we could leave (without a refund).
ID-0843	This Hotel is filthy, bedbugs, dirt, mold, the bedding looked dirty. There is only one person that runs the front desk and he is old and does not speak english. I could not get a refund for my stay and I wanted to get out of this place as soon as I walked into the room. There are obvious drug users and other illegal activity on the premises. I would never stay here again. The front desk operator is rude and the place is not worth what I paid for it. If I wanted to pay for bedbugs and filth I wouldnt have had a problem with the place. They alley would have been cleaner and probably safer. STAY AWAY!!!!
