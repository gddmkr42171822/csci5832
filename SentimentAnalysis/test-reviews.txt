ID-1238	I've stayed at the 16th Street Mall Westin more than 60 nights in the past four years, on a combined business/personal trips. The staff and management of the hotel have always been friendly and guest driven in their service.   Love the hotel's location. In fact the reason I first stayed at the hotel is the fact it's on the 16th Street Mall and within walking distance of our corporate office. In fact after the first trip I stopped renting a car, there just was no need for one. The view of the mountains from the upper floors is breathtaking. The king sized bed has always been world class, as they are in every Westin I've stayed at.  The room comfort and staff friendliness are the reason I stay at this hotel every trip to Denver.
ID-1092	I'm a frequent traveler to Japan, and of all the hotels I've stayed in, my favorite, by far, has been the Park Hotel Tokyo. The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.
ID-1270	This hotel and resort is wonderful for family events. The three pools are an added bonus. There are many activities to enjoy year round.
ID-1192	The Pearl River Hilton offers an incredibly upscale experience. The hotel boasts 17 acres of extraordinary landscape, a full pool, and a gourmet restaurant on premise. The staff is extremely friendly, and the rooms are very comfortable - all with a great view! Additionally, there are many conference and event rooms in a separate wing available for your next special event.
ID-1216	I have no complaints and I’m a picky hotel guest. The room was clean, the sheets were not old, and the bathroom was spotless. Everything worked properly which made for a great experience while getting ready for an interview. The front desk staff was more the helpful. They gave us advice on where to eat, information on the city, and the place I was interviewing at. The continental breakfast had lots of unique options; it went beyond the average spread at a hotel. I’m impressed.
ID-1274	Absolutely a great hotel for families! The rooms are spacious, restaraunts are very kid-friendly, and the pool area is gorgeous. My children felt like they were at a water park, not just another hotel. We will definitely return for another stay here!
ID-1102	The hotel was enjoyable because the price was reasonable and the service was quick.
ID-1082	This hotel is conveniently located just blocks from the world-famous Waikiki beach. The room price was very reasonable, and the hotel had a lot of great amenities, such as a pool, hot tub, bar, restaurant, and gift shop. The room was quite comfortable with a great view of the city, although I know that for a little more money nightly, the hotel also provides rooms that have an ocean view. The room was secure. It had a nice bathroom with a hair dryer. It also had a closet with hangers, and an ironing board and iron. There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area. Furthermore, I really liked the hotel lobby--it is a nice open air lobby with tables to sit at and have breakfast. There is a lovely fountain and koi pond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a budget, but would like to experience Hawaii nonetheless.
ID-1036	Over the holidays, we stayed at the Westin in St. Louis,MO. The hotel is stunning! It's located right across from the Cardinals Stadium. The hotel staff was very accommodating. We requested more towels at midnight and they were up there within minutes! The rooms were absolutely gorgeous. The beds were extremely comfortable. My daughter loved that there was a phone in the bathroom! Great experience overall.
ID-1124	The Ocean Creek Resort in Myrtle Beach is the Best!The Hotel is situated on the water in Myrtle Beach and has several pools for both adults and children. Because of the location near a creek the water is great for little children. The rooms are spacious and bright. the staff is very friendly and accommodating to your needs. The ocean side bar is perfect for sitting back and listening to music.
ID-0963	A couple of friends and my wife decided to take a one day short trip to the North Shore of Minnesota and at the end of teh day were so exhausted that we decided to stay in a hotel there rather than driving back to the Twin Cities. We stayed at the Grand Superior Lodge. Big disappointment. While they had rooms available, the hotel was so rustic the beds seemed old and were uncomfortable, and their restaurant closed at 8pm. In fact, all of the staff disappeared at around that time so we had to venture into town to find a place to eat. There were no amenities at the hotel and their only plus was the nice view of the lake they had. I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all.
ID-0873	When we reserved a reservation at La Quinta Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, we expected a decent nights sleep at a fairly decent price. We have stayed at La Quinta before and were always satisfied. This particular hotel is not what we expected. It is run down and dirty in the rooms. Also the noise level was a constant all night with the parties going on in numerous rooms around ours. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy!
ID-1029	We recently stayed at the Country Inn and Suites in Mishawaka, IN. It seemed dark and had a musty smell. The indoor swimming pool had debris in it so we didn't even get to use it. The carpet also had stains. I would highly recommend staying at a different hotel in this area if you are looking for something that feels new and fresh.
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer. The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping! I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water! All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!
ID-0811	The Rio hotel is the absolute worst hotel I've stayed in on or just off the strip! It had the worst service! As we would stroll down the rundown hallways the smell of room service dishes and smoke was so dissapointing! The same left over food was left out for our two days stay. We could smell smoke in our rooms from the casino. My husband had trouble sleeping as the neon lights could be seen in our rooms with the curtains drawn. The casino was like an old bar room. Really bad ventilation! Last but not least! It took over sixty minutes to check out!
ID-0907	My husband and I were moving from Colorado to Georgia and were using Super 8 motels almost exclusively because they had a policy of allowing dogs in the rooms. We reserved a room in St. Louis at the Super 8 and were dismayed to hear the manager tell us that he did not allow dogs in the rooms. This was in violation of Super 8 policy. I told the manager this so he said he could give us a room in a special area of the motel. The room he put us in was dirty with stains on the carpet and walls. We were so exhausted from travelling cross country that we took the substandard room so we could be sure our dogs would be safe. This was by far the worst Super 8 we had ever stayed at. The manager lied to us and violated Super 8 policy when the computer clearly indicated that dogs were welcome at this motel.
ID-0931	Stay away from this hotel!!! My fiance and I ended up staying at a Motel 6 on vacation due to their popularity and decent reputation, and especially for the fair pricing, however, this experience was something that was almost enough to ruin our entire trip. The room had no working air conditioner, and it was summer!!! No matter how many times we informed the front desk, they didn't send out maintenance. The sheets had yellow stains, and the entire room smelled awful. The shower head had terrible water pressure, but, this again was something that was never fixed. Eventually we just ended up leaving the hotel and paying double price for a hotel of the same caliber. Absolutely awful experience.
ID-0953	When I checked into the hotel, I was informed the elevator was not working. I had to truck up the stairs, with my luggage, by self. I was provided no help from the staff. The air conditioner was broken, which created a very stuffy room. When I took a shower, the stopper was stuck shut, so by the end of the shower, the water was almost overflowing.
ID-1001	The hotel was pretty nice on the outside for the most part, but when we got to the hallway our room was on the wall paper was in the middle of being replaced so it was all torn down, the carpets were getting ripped up. If they were in the middle of renovations I wish they just put us in a different hallway, or at least given us a discount.
