Changes I made to the MaxMatch strategy:
    1) instead of taking the largest word that fits take the smallest word greater >= 2 characters *this was not an improvement*
    2) maxmatch backwards instead of forwards *improved WER from .60 to .35*
    3) don't add spaces after characters not found in corpus *improved WER from .39 to .35*
    4) run maxmatch both ways and take output with fewer words, if same number take reverse maxmatch *did not try this*
    5) check for the largest string in any part of the hashtag instead of just at the front or end *improved WER from .35 to .29*
    
Changes to gready nature
    1) if there is a single letter at the end of the string combine it with the previous word *greedy nature changed, improved WER from .66 to .60* 

Changes to lexicon
    1) do not take single characters to be words in the word list/lexicon *this did not improve anything*
    2) clean up lexicon/corpus/wordlist to not include typos
    3) remove and insert as many words as possible to correct the output *improve WER from .29 to .11*
